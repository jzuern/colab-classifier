### Training of a Resnet50 classifier on the MNIST skin cancer 10000 data set


# Architecture

Based on ResNet-50 architecture by Wenxin Xu (https://github.com/wenxinxu/resnet_in_tensorflow)



# TODO

- clone classifier code from github
- !different activation functions
- Debug confusion matrix
- clean up code
- Why validation error not decreasing?
